## Exercise 1
- How would you list all the databases available on the system?
```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
>Note: `SHOW TABLE;` is not the correct syntax - it should be `SHOW TABLES;` to list tables within a database.

- Which statement is used to list the information about a table? How do you use this statement?
```sql
DESCRIBE employee_data;
```

>Note: `SELECT * FROM employee_data` shows the actual data in the table, while `DESCRIBE` shows the table structure (column names, data types, etc.)

- Write the statement for inserting the following data in employee_data table
	- **Data to insert:**
		- First name: Ushik
		- Last name: Shrestha
		- Title: Database Instructor
		- Age: 34
		- Years of service: 2
		- Salary: 95000
		- Perks: 17000
		- Email: ushik@bignet.com
```sql
INSERT INTO employee_data (f_name, l_name, title, age, yos, salary, perks, email) 
VALUES ('Ushik', 'Shrestha', 'Database Instructor', 34, 2, 95000, 17000, 'ushik@bignet.com');
```

- Write the statement for listing data from salary, perks and yos (year of service) columns of employee_data table
```sql
SELECT salary, perks, yos FROM employee_data;
```
## Exercise 2
- What will the following SELECT statement display?
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_data WHERE salary <= 100000;
```
**Answer:** It will display all employee data for employees whose salary is less than or equal to 100,000.

- Write SELECT statement to extract the ids of employees who are more than 30 years of age
```sql
SELECT emp_id FROM employee_data WHERE age > 30;
```

- Write SELECT statement to extract the first and last names of all web designers
```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employee_data WHERE title = 'Web Designer';
```

- List all full name of employees (last name followed by first name) who hold the title of Marketing Executive
```sql
SELECT l_name, f_name FROM employee_data WHERE title = 'Marketing Executive';
```
## Exercise 3
- What is displayed by the following statement?
```sql

```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employee_data WHERE salary <= 90000 AND title NOT LIKE '%Programmer%'
```

- List all ids and names of all employees between 32 and 40 years of age.
```sql
SELECT emp_id, f_name, l_name FROM employee_data WHERE age >= 32 AND age <= 40
```

```sql
SELECT emp_id, f_name, l_name FROM employee_data WHERE age BETWEEN 32 AND 40;
```

```sql
SELECT emp_id,
       f_name + ' ' + l_name AS full_name
FROM employee_data
WHERE age BETWEEN 32 AND 40;
```

- Select names of all employees who are 32 years of age and are not programmers.
```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employee_data WHERE age = 32 AND title NOT LIKE '%Programmer%'
```
## Exercise 4
- List the names of 3 youngest employees in the company.
```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name FROM employee_data ORDER BY age LIMIT 3
```

- Extract the next 5 entries starting with the 4th row.
```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name
FROM employee_data
ORDER BY age ASC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 3;
```

- Display the names and salary of the employee who draws the largest salary.
```sql
SELECT f_name, l_name
FROM employee_data
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- What does the following statement display?
```sql
