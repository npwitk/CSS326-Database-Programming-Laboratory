# Lab Assignment 8 - Database Security

## STEP 0: Import the Database

```bash
mysql -u root -p

# Create the cust database if it doesn't exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cust;

# Exit and import the SQL file
exit

# Import the Bank.sql file into cust database
mysql -u root -p cust < Bank.sql

# Or in phpMyAdmin: Select cust database > Import > Choose Bank.sql file > Go
```

### Verify the Import

```sql
mysql -u root -p

-- Use the database
USE cust;

-- Check tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- Check account table structure
DESCRIBE account;

-- Check transaction table structure  
DESCRIBE transaction;

-- View sample data
SELECT * FROM account;
SELECT * FROM transaction;
```

## PART 1: Define User Accounts

### Understanding the Security Levels:

Based on **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** from the lecture:

1. **Admin (TS - Top Secret)** - Full database control (all operations)
2. **Staff (S - Secret)** - Manage accounts and transactions (CRUD operations)
3. **Customer (C - Confidential)** - View their own account information only (read-only)

### SQL Statements to Create Users:

```sql
-- Create Admin User (Top Secret Level)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'cust_admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Admin@2025';

-- Create Staff User (Secret Level)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'cust_staff'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Staff@2025';

-- Create Customer User (Confidential Level)
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'cust_customer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Customer@2025';
```

### Grant Privileges Based on Security Levels:

```sql
-- 1. ADMIN PRIVILEGES (Top Secret - TS)
-- Account level privileges: Full control over the cust database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cust.* TO 'cust_admin'@'localhost';

-- 2. STAFF PRIVILEGES (Secret - S)
-- Relationship level access control
-- Can perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on account table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON cust.account TO 'cust_staff'@'localhost';

-- Can perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE on transaction table
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON cust.transaction TO 'cust_staff'@'localhost';

-- 3. CUSTOMER PRIVILEGES (Confidential - C)
-- Can only view the account_view (will be created in Part 3)
-- Read-only access to limited account information
-- Note: This will be granted after creating the view in Part 3
-- GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_view TO 'cust_customer'@'localhost';

-- Apply all privilege changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Verify Users and Privileges:

```sql
-- Show all users
SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE User LIKE 'cust_%';

-- Show privileges for admin
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cust_admin'@'localhost';

-- Show privileges for staff
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cust_staff'@'localhost';

-- Show privileges for customer
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'cust_customer'@'localhost';
```

### Test User Access:

```bash
# Test Admin Login
mysql -u cust_admin -pAdmin@2025 cust

# Test Staff Login
mysql -u cust_staff -pStaff@2025 cust

# Test Customer Login (after creating view in Part 3)
mysql -u cust_customer -pCustomer@2025 cust
```

## PART 2: Protect Sensitive Data with Encryption

### Identified Sensitive Data:

1. **CreditLimit** - Financial data (credit worthiness)
2. **bal** - Account balance (financial data)
3. **amount** - Transaction amounts (financial data)
4. **Name** - Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
5. **No.** - Account number (should be kept confidential)

### Protection Strategy Using Lecture Methods:

1. **Encryption** - Use AES_ENCRYPT with SHA1 key (from lecture Exercise 3)
2. **Access Control** - Restrict direct table access
3. **Views** - Provide controlled access to decrypted data
4. **Input Validation** - Protect against SQL injection

### SQL Statements for Data Protection:

```sql
-- PROTECTION 1: Modify columns to store encrypted data (BLOB type)
-- First, backup the original data structure
ALTER TABLE account 
MODIFY CreditLimit BLOB,
MODIFY bal BLOB;

ALTER TABLE transaction
MODIFY amount BLOB;

-- PROTECTION 2: Encrypt sensitive financial data using AES with SHA1 key
-- Encrypt CreditLimit in account table
UPDATE account 
SET CreditLimit = AES_ENCRYPT(CreditLimit, SHA1('creditlimit_key'));

-- Encrypt balance (bal) in account table
UPDATE account 
SET bal = AES_ENCRYPT(bal, SHA1('balance_key'));

-- Encrypt amount in transaction table
UPDATE transaction 
SET amount = AES_ENCRYPT(amount, SHA1('amount_key'));

-- PROTECTION 3: Encrypt account numbers using MD5 (one-way hash)
-- Add a new column for hashed account number
ALTER TABLE account 
ADD COLUMN No_hash VARCHAR(32);

-- Hash the account numbers (one-way encryption)
UPDATE account 
SET No_hash = MD5(`No.`);

-- PROTECTION 4: Create secure password storage example
-- If you had a password field, use SHA1 for one-way hashing
-- Example structure (for reference):
-- CREATE TABLE user_credentials (
--     user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
--     username VARCHAR(50),
--     password_hash VARCHAR(40),  -- SHA1 produces 40-character hash
--     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
-- );
-- 
-- INSERT INTO user_credentials (user_id, username, password_hash)
-- VALUES (1, 'admin', SHA1('Admin@2025'));

-- PROTECTION 5: Revoke Direct Access to Encrypted Tables
-- Customers should not have direct access to account or transaction tables
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cust.account FROM 'cust_customer'@'localhost';
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON cust.transaction FROM 'cust_customer'@'localhost';

-- Customers can only access through the view (granted in Part 3)
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- PROTECTION 6: Prevent SQL Injection - Input Validation Function
-- Create a function to validate account numbers (prevent injection)
DELIMITER $$
CREATE FUNCTION validate_account_input(input_value VARCHAR(255))
RETURNS BOOLEAN
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    -- Check if input contains only alphanumeric characters
    -- Returns TRUE if valid, FALSE if potentially malicious
    IF input_value REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9]+$' THEN
        RETURN TRUE;
    ELSE
        RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
```

### Create Decryption Views for Authorized Users:

```sql
-- Create a view that decrypts data for staff (who have proper authorization)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS account_decrypted;

CREATE VIEW account_decrypted AS
SELECT 
    ID,
    `No.`,
    No_hash,
    Name,
    CAST(AES_DECRYPT(CreditLimit, SHA1('creditlimit_key')) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS CreditLimit,
    CAST(AES_DECRYPT(bal, SHA1('balance_key')) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS bal
FROM account;

-- Grant access to decrypted view for staff and admin only
GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_decrypted TO 'cust_staff'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_decrypted TO 'cust_admin'@'localhost';

-- Create decrypted transaction view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS transaction_decrypted;

CREATE VIEW transaction_decrypted AS
SELECT 
    id,
    accid,
    CAST(AES_DECRYPT(amount, SHA1('amount_key')) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS amount
FROM transaction;

-- Grant access to decrypted transaction view
GRANT SELECT ON cust.transaction_decrypted TO 'cust_staff'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT ON cust.transaction_decrypted TO 'cust_admin'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Verify Encryption:

```sql
-- Check encrypted data (should see BLOB/binary data)
SELECT ID, Name, CreditLimit, bal FROM account LIMIT 3;

-- Check decrypted data through view (should see normal numbers)
SELECT * FROM account_decrypted LIMIT 3;

-- Verify hashed account numbers
SELECT `No.`, No_hash FROM account LIMIT 3;

-- Test the validation function
SELECT validate_account_input('12345');  -- Returns 1 (TRUE - valid)
SELECT validate_account_input('123 OR 1=1');  -- Returns 0 (FALSE - SQL injection attempt)
```

---

## PART 3: Create View for Customers

### View Requirements (Based on Lecture Exercise 2):
- Contains: account no., name, balance (decrypted)
- Provides read-only access for customers
- Hides sensitive information (CreditLimit)
- Uses WITH CHECK OPTION for data integrity

### SQL Statements to Create View:

```sql
-- Drop view if it already exists (for clean creation)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS account_view;

-- Create the view with account number, name, and decrypted balance
-- This view decrypts the balance for customer viewing
CREATE VIEW account_view AS
SELECT 
    `No.` AS account_no,
    Name AS name,
    CAST(AES_DECRYPT(bal, SHA1('balance_key')) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS balance
FROM account
WITH CHECK OPTION;  -- Ensures updates through view satisfy the WHERE clause

-- Grant SELECT permission to customers on this view
GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_view TO 'cust_customer'@'localhost';

-- Grant SELECT permission to staff on this view  
GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_view TO 'cust_staff'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Enhanced Security View (Optional - Based on Lecture Concepts):

```sql
-- Create a more secure view that masks part of the account number
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS account_view_secure;

CREATE VIEW account_view_secure AS
SELECT 
    CONCAT('****', RIGHT(`No.`, 4)) AS masked_account_no,
    Name AS name,
    CAST(AES_DECRYPT(bal, SHA1('balance_key')) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS balance
FROM account;

-- Grant access to this masked view
GRANT SELECT ON cust.account_view_secure TO 'cust_customer'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Verify the View:

```sql
-- Check if view exists
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_type = 'VIEW';

-- View the structure
DESCRIBE account_view;

-- Test the view as admin
SELECT * FROM account_view;

-- Test modification through view (based on lecture Exercise 2)
-- Update a customer's balance through the view
UPDATE account_view 
SET balance = 15000.00 
WHERE account_no = '12345';  -- Replace with actual account number

-- Note: This will encrypt the new value automatically due to triggers
-- (if implemented) or requires manual encryption
```

---

## Complete Testing Procedure

### Test as Admin:

```sql
-- Login as admin
-- mysql -u cust_admin -pAdmin@2025 cust

-- Admin can view encrypted data
SELECT * FROM account LIMIT 3;

-- Admin can view decrypted data
SELECT * FROM account_decrypted LIMIT 3;
SELECT * FROM transaction_decrypted LIMIT 3;

-- Admin can view customer view
SELECT * FROM account_view LIMIT 3;

-- Admin can modify encrypted data
UPDATE account 
SET bal = AES_ENCRYPT('14000', SHA1('balance_key')) 
WHERE ID = 105;
```

### Test as Staff:

```sql
-- Login as staff
-- mysql -u cust_staff -pStaff@2025 cust

-- Staff can view through decrypted views
SELECT * FROM account_decrypted;
SELECT * FROM transaction_decrypted;

-- Staff can access the customer view
SELECT * FROM account_view;

-- Staff can modify data (but sees encrypted values in raw table)
UPDATE account 
SET bal = AES_ENCRYPT('13500', SHA1('balance_key')) 
WHERE ID = 105;

-- Staff CANNOT access encrypted tables directly (should see encrypted data)
SELECT * FROM account LIMIT 3;  -- Will show BLOB data
```

### Test as Customer:

```sql
-- Login as customer
-- mysql -u cust_customer -pCustomer@2025 cust

-- Customer can ONLY view the account_view (sees decrypted balance)
SELECT * FROM account_view;

-- Customer can also use the secure masked view
SELECT * FROM account_view_secure;

-- Customer CANNOT access tables directly (should get permission denied)
SELECT * FROM account;  -- ERROR: Access denied
SELECT * FROM transaction;  -- ERROR: Access denied

-- Customer CANNOT access decrypted views (should get permission denied)
SELECT * FROM account_decrypted;  -- ERROR: Access denied

-- Customer CANNOT modify anything
UPDATE account_view SET balance = 20000;  -- ERROR: Access denied
```

### Test SQL Injection Protection:

```sql
-- As admin, test the validation function
SELECT validate_account_input('12345');  -- Valid input: 1
SELECT validate_account_input('admin'' OR ''1''=''1');  -- Injection attempt: 0
SELECT validate_account_input('105 OR 1=1');  -- Injection attempt: 0
SELECT validate_account_input('DROP TABLE account');  -- Injection attempt: 0
```

## Security Concepts Applied from Lecture

### 1. Encryption Methods Used:
- **AES_ENCRYPT/AES_DECRYPT** - Symmetric encryption for reversible data (balance, credit limit, amounts)
- **SHA1** - Secure hash algorithm used as encryption key
- **MD5** - One-way hashing for account numbers

### 2. Access Control Models:
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)** - Granting specific privileges
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)** - Security level classification (TS > S > C > U)

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention:
- Input validation function
- Parameterized approach through stored procedures

### 4. View Implementation:
- **WITH CHECK OPTION** for data integrity
- Views for data abstraction and security
- Decryption views for authorized users only

### 5. Best Practices Applied:
- Changed default user names
- Strong password requirements
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular privilege flushing
- Separation of duties

## Additional Notes

### Why These Encryption Methods?

1. **AES_ENCRYPT** - Used for financial data because:
   - It's reversible (staff/admin need to see actual amounts)
   - Symmetric encryption is fast
   - Strong security for sensitive data

2. **SHA1 as Key** - Used because:
   - Creates consistent key from password phrase
   - One-way hash adds extra security layer
   - Easy to implement and remember

3. **MD5 for Account Numbers** - Used because:
   - One-way hash (cannot be reversed)
   - Quick comparison for validation
   - Protects original account numbers

### Security Trade-offs

- **Performance**: Encryption/decryption adds processing overhead
- **Usability**: Staff must use decrypted views instead of raw tables
- **Key Management**: SHA1 keys are hardcoded (in production, use proper key management)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Encrypted columns can't be directly queried without decryption
